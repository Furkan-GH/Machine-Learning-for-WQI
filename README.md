This is my first project about Machine Learning.

While I was searching machine learnings subject ,I found that article. It was about Water Quality Index.
Then, I searched dataset that I used with my project. I found dataset about that can help me find the quality of Indian waters.
Important factors when finding the quality of water are: **Dissolved Oxygen(mg/L)**,**pH**,**Conductivity(S/cm)**,**Nitrate(mg/L)**,**Biological Oxygen Demand(mg/L)**,
**Fecal Coliform(/100mL)**,**Total Coliform(/100mL)**. Not only do you know these things!!
I edited the data set and made it ready for learning.
To measure water quality, I adapted the formula for each row with the items given in the dataset and outputted a water quality index.

The methods I use in machine learning are as follows:

**Logistic Regression**

**SVM**

**Decision tree**

**XGBoost**

**MLP**

**Random forest** 

**CATBoost**

I gained the achievements in this table from these methods.
